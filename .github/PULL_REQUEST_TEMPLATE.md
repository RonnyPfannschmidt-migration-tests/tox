Thanks for contributing a pull request!

If you are contributing for the first time or provide a trivial fix don't worry too much about the checklist - we will help you get started.

## Contribution checklist:

- [ ] has descriptive pull request text
- [ ] tests added/updated
- [ ] documentation updated
- [ ] [if applicable] uses correct [issue keyword](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) to message body
- [ ] added news fragment in [changelog folder](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/tree/master/changelog)
  * fragment name: `<issue number>.<type>` for example (588.bug)
  * `<type>` is must be one of `bugfix`, `feature`, `deprecation`,`breaking`, `doc`, `misc`
  * if pr has no issue: consider creating one first or change it to the pr number after creating the pr
  * "sign" fragment with "by @<your username>"
  * please use full sentences with correct case and punctuation, for example: "Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files - by @superuser."

Unless you don't want to or your change is trivial or a documentation fix (e.g. typo or small rewording) ...
