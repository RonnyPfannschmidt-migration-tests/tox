# tox automation project

**Command line driven CI frontend and development task automation tool**

At its core tox povides a convenient way to run arbitrary commands in isolated environments to serve as a single entry point for build, test and release activities.

tox is highly [configurable](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) and [pluggable](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html).

## How it works

tox creates virtual environments for all configured so called `testenvs`, it then installs the project and other necessary dependencies and runs the configured set of commands.

![tox flow](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/tox_flow.png)

See [system overview](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#system-overview) for more details.

## tox can be used for ...

* creating develepment environments
* running static code analysis and test tools
* automating package builds
* running tests against the package build by tox
* checking that packages install correctly with different Python versions/interpreters
* unifying Continuous Integration and command line based testing
* building and deploying project documentation
* release automation
* limit: your imagination

## Usage

tox is mainly used as a command line tool and needs a `tox.ini` or a `tool.tox`
section in `pyproject.toml` containing the configuration.

### A simple example

To test a simple project that has some tests, here is an example with the `tox.ini`
in the root of the project:

```ini
[tox]
envlist = py27,py36

[testenv]
deps = pytest       # install pytest in the virtualenv where commands will be executed
commands =
    # whatever extra steps before testing might be necessary
    pytest          # or any other test runner that you might use
```

```console
$ tox

[lots of output from what tox does]
[lots of output from commands that were run]

__________________ summary _________________
  py27: commands succeeded
  py36: commands succeeded
  congratulations :)
```

tox created two `testenvs` - one based on Python2.7 and one based on Python3.6, it installed pytest in them and ran the tests. The report at the end summarizes which
`testenvs` have failed and which have succeeded.
