fix performing pip upgrades on Windows using the tox's default install_command
- by @jurko-gospodnetic

Changes:

- default `install_command` changed to ``python -m pip`` instead of the
  setuptools based ``pip`` executable
- now the install commands are run from the ``{toxinidir}/install_from_here``
  folder to avoid install commands (e.g. ``python -m pip``) accidentally picking
  up ``.egg-info`` folders in the current working folder as indications of
  already installed packages, thus causing it to potentially not install those
  packages into the target environment
