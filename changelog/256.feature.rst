Add a ``-q`` option to progressively silence tox's output. For each time you specify ``-q`` to tox,
the output provided by tox reduces. This option allows you to see only your command output without
the default verbosity of what tox is doing. This also counter-acts usage of ``-v``. For example,
running ``tox -v -q ...`` will provide you with the default verbosity. ``tox -vv -q`` is equivalent
to ``tox -v``. By @sigmavirus24
