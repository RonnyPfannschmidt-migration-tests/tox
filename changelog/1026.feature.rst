Added ``temp_dir`` folder configuration (defaults to ``{toxworkdir}/.tmp``) that contains tox
temporary files. Package builds now create a hard link (if possible, otherwise copy - notably in
case of Windows Python 2.7) to the built file, and feed that file downstream (e.g. for pip to
install it). The hard link is removed at the end of the run (what it points though is kept
inside ``distdir``). This ensures that a tox session operates on the same package it built, even
if a parallel tox run builds another version. Note ``distdir`` will contain only the last built
package in such cases. - by :user:`gaborbernat`
