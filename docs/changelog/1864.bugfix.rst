Various small bugfixes:

- honor updating default environment variables set by internal tox via set env (``PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK``)
- do not multi-wrap ``HandledError`` in the ini file loader,
- skipped environments are logged now with their fail message at default verbosity level,
- fix an error that made the show configuration command crash when making the string of a config value failed,
- support empty-new lines within the set env configurations replacements,
