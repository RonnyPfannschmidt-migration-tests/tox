tox can now be invoked with a new ``--no-provision`` flag that prevents provision,
if :conf:`requires` or :conf:`minversion` are not satisfied,
tox will fail;
if a path is specified as an argument to the flag
(e.g. as ``tox --no-provision missing.json``) and provision is prevented,
provision metadata are written as JSON to that path - by :user:`hroncok`
