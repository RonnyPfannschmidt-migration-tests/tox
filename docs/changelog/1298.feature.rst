``--showconfig`` overhaul:

- now fully generated via the config parser, so anyone can load it by using the built-in python config parser
- the ``tox`` section contains all configuration data from config
- the ``tox`` section contains a ``host_python`` key detailing the path of the host python
- the ``tox:version`` section contains the versions of all packages tox depends on with their version
- passing ``-l`` now allows only listing default target envs
- allows showing config for a given set of tox environments only via the ``-e`` cli flag or the ``TOXENV`` environment
  variable, in this case the ``tox`` and ``tox:version`` section is only shown if at least one verbosity flag is passed

this should help inspecting the options.
