Rework how we handle python packaging environments:

- the base packaging environment changed from ``.package`` to ``.pkg``,
- merged the ``sdist``, ``wheel`` and ``dev`` separate packaging implementations into one, and internally dynamically
  pick the one that's needed,
- the base packaging environment always uses the same python environment as tox is installed into,
- the base packaging environment is used to get the metadata of the project (via PEP-517) and to build ``sdist`` and
  ``dev`` packages,
- for building wheels introduced a new per env configurable option ``wheel_build_env``, if the target python major/minor
  and implementation for the run tox environment and the base package tox environment matches set this to ``.pkg``,
  otherwise this is ``.pkg-{implementation}{major}{minor}``,
- internally now packaging environments can create further packaging environments they are responsible of managing,
- updated ``depends`` to use the packaging logic,
- add support skip missing interpreters for depends and show config,
