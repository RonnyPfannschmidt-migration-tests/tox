Improve python discovery and add architecture support:
 - UNIX:

   - First, check if the tox host Python matches.
   - Second, check if the the canonical name (e.g. ``python3.7``, ``python3``) matches or the base python is an absolute path, use that.
   - Third, check if the the canonical name without version matches (e.g. ``python``, ``pypy``) matches.

 - Windows:

   - First, check if the tox host Python matches.
   - Second, use the ``py.exe`` to list registered interpreters and any of those match.
   - Third, check if the the canonical name (e.g. ``python3.7``, ``python3``) matches or the base python is an absolute path, use that.
   - Fourth, check if the the canonical name without version matches (e.g. ``python``, ``pypy``) matches.
   - Finally, check for known locations (``c:\python{major}{minor}\python.exe``).


tox environment configuration generation is now done in parallel (to alleviate the slowdown due to extra
checks).
