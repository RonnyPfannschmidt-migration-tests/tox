tox automation project
======================

**Command line driven CI frontend and development task automation tool**

At its core tox povides a convenient way to run arbitrary commands in
isolated environments to serve as a single entry point for build, test
and release activities.

tox is highly
`configurable <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html>`__ and
`pluggable <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html>`__.

How it works
------------

tox creates virtual environments for all configured so called
``testenvs``, it then installs the project and other necessary
dependencies and runs the configured set of commands.

See `system
overview <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#system-overview>`__ for
more details.

tox can be used for â€¦
---------------------

-  creating development environments
-  running static code analysis and test tools
-  automating package builds
-  running tests against the package build by tox
-  checking that packages install correctly with different Python
   versions/interpreters
-  unifying Continuous Integration and command line based testing
-  building and deploying project documentation
-  releasing a package to PyPI or any other platform
-  limit: your imagination

Usage
-----

tox is mainly used as a command line tool and needs a ``tox.ini`` or a
``tool.tox`` section in ``pyproject.toml`` containing the configuration.

A simple example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test a simple project that has some tests, here is an example with
the ``tox.ini`` in the root of the project:

.. code:: ini

   [tox]
   envlist = py27,py37

   [testenv]
   deps = pytest
   commands = pytest

.. code:: console

   $ tox

   [lots of output from what tox does]
   [lots of output from commands that were run]

   __________________ summary _________________
     py27: commands succeeded
     py37: commands succeeded
     congratulations :)

tox created two ``testenvs`` - one based on Python2.7 and one based on
Python3.7, it installed pytest in them and ran the tests. The report at
the end summarizes which ``testenvs`` have failed and which have
succeeded.
