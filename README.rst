tox automation project
======================

**Command line driven CI frontend and development task automation tool**

At its core tox povides a convenient way to run arbitrary commands in
isolated environments to serve as a single entry point for build, test
and release activities.

tox is highly
`configurable <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html>`__ and
`pluggable <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html>`__.

A simple example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

tox is mainly used as a command line tool and needs a ``tox.ini`` or a
``tool.tox`` section in ``pyproject.toml`` containing the configuration.

To test a simple project that has some tests, here is an example with
the ``tox.ini`` in the root of the project:

.. code:: ini

   [tox]
   envlist = py27,py37

   [testenv]
   deps = pytest
   commands = pytest

.. code:: console

   $ tox

   [lots of output from what tox does]
   [lots of output from commands that were run]

   __________________ summary _________________
     py27: commands succeeded
     py37: commands succeeded
     congratulations :)

tox created two ``testenvs`` - one based on Python2.7 and one based on
Python3.7, it installed pytest in them and ran the tests. The report at
the end summarizes which ``testenvs`` have failed and which have
succeeded.

**Note:** To learn more about what you can do with tox, have a look at `existing projects using tox <https://github.com/search?l=INI&q=tox.ini+in%3Apath&type=Code>`__.

How it works
------------

tox creates virtual environments for all configured so called
``testenvs``, it then installs the project and other necessary
dependencies and runs the configured set of commands. See `system
overview <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#system-overview>`__
for more details.
